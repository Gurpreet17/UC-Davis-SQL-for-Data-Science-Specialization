# SQL-for-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
My Capstone Project for SportStats is a culmination of the knowledge and skills I have gained in the field of data science, particularly focused on SQL. This project serves as an opportunity for me to apply my SQL skills to analyze data and solve real-world business problems.

The project is designed to build upon the foundation established in the previous courses of the Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization. Whether I have completed all the previous courses or only this one, this project allows me to demonstrate my abilities by practicing essential SQL querying techniques and addressing data-related challenges. Throughout this project, I will embark on a personal or professional journey, taking a dataset of my choice and developing a comprehensive project proposal.

The initial phase involves exploring the dataset and conducting descriptive statistics, applying the analytical techniques I have learned during the specialization. This exploratory analysis will provide valuable insights into the data, and I will have the opportunity to uncover meaningful patterns and extract valuable information using SQL. Additionally, I will develop metrics and employ advanced SQL techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the data and extract actionable insights.

The project will culminate in the form of a presentation where I will effectively communicate the story of my findings. This presentation will showcase the results of my analysis, including both descriptive statistics and advanced SQL techniques. The objective is to provide clear and compelling recommendations based on the data-driven insights obtained throughout the project.

As part of the project, I will also engage in a peer-review process, receiving valuable feedback from fellow learners in the community. This feedback will help me refine my approach to data analysis with SQL and enhance my ability to present findings to clients and management effectively.

Throughout this Capstone Project, I will develop essential skills such as project proposal development, data selection, exploratory analysis, descriptive statistics, advanced SQL techniques, and effective data presentation. By completing this project, I will not only demonstrate my proficiency in SQL and data analysis but also create a portfolio-worthy piece that showcases my ability to apply SQL skills to real-world business problems.

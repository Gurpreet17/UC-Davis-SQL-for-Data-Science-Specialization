I am excited to share that I have completed the "SQL for Data Science: Advanced Techniques" course offered by the University of California Davis. This certificate program has allowed me to apply the SQL skills I learned in the foundational course to four increasingly complex and authentic data science inquiry case studies.

Throughout the program, I learned how to convert timestamps of all types to common formats and perform date/time calculations. I gained expertise in selecting and performing the optimal JOIN for a data science inquiry and cleaning data within an analysis dataset by deduping, running quality checks, backfilling, and handling nulls.

I also learned how to segment and analyze data per segment using windowing functions and use case statements to execute conditional logic to address a data science inquiry. Additionally, I gained an understanding of how to convert a query into a scheduled job and how to insert data into a date partition.

One of the most valuable aspects of this program was the opportunity to engineer a feature from raw data using the tools and skills we developed over the course. This skill set will be incredibly useful in the real world as I tackle predictive analysis needs and perform the analysis of an AB test.

Overall, I highly recommend this program to anyone interested in advancing their SQL skills and applying them to complex data science problems. The knowledge and skills gained through this program have already proven to be incredibly valuable in my career, and I am excited to continue building on this foundation.

--Exercise 1:
--Using the table from Exercise 4.3 and compute a metric that measures
--Whether a user created an order after their test assignment
--Requirements: Even if a user had zero orders, we should have a row that counts
-- their number of orders as zero
--If the user is not in the experiment they should not be included

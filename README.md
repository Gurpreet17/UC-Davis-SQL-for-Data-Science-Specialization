# SQL-for-Data-Science Certificate
This repository is for the SQL assignments I completed as part of the "SQL for Data Science" course offered by the University of California, Davis. Throughout this course, I gained a strong understanding of SQL fundamentals and how to use SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data.

In this repository, you will find a series of SQL assignments that I completed, covering topics such as data types, querying data, filtering data, sorting data, joining tables, and more. Each assignment includes a detailed description of the task and the code I used to complete it.

Through these assignments, I have gained hands-on experience working with SQL and have improved my skills in writing efficient and effective SQL queries. I have also learned how to work with real-world datasets, extract meaningful insights from data, and communicate my findings to stakeholders.

Overall, this course has provided me with a solid foundation in SQL for data science, and I am excited to continue building upon my knowledge in this area.
